On a daily basis I use 2 DAWs, Ableton and Pro Tools.  Ableton I learned by choice, Pro Tools was forced upon me by industry and classes.  The past sentence says a lot about my initial impressions of the two, but I can say that over time I have grown to really appreciate aspects of both.

In my mind the biggest difference between Ableton and Pro Tools is the philisophical choice between starting new, vs building on existing ideas and infrastructure.  This difference manifests in industries ranging from construction to code, and both sides have pretty valid arguments.  Evolving an existing design or product comes with a lot of benefits.  Thinking in terms of construction, a strong foundation means you can spend time working on building extra stories that reach higher.  Reworking rather than restarting also helps keep the apple from falling far from the tree: good features of the last product will almost certainly make it into the new product.  Starting from scratch is ultimately riskier, but can have greater rewards as well. Reworkers can use a strong foundation to build a building.  Restarters have no use for bricks, as they are building a plane.  Sometimes re-implementing the basics doesn't actually take that long, and can yield neater, easier to work with, or overall better results.  Starting from scratch, however, comes with large risks too.  The final product will cost more to make, and is not guaranteed to find a market, as there may not be anything quite like it.

When Digidesign set out to make Pro Tools, the de-facto way to record music was in a large studio on analog equipment.  Selling recording engineers on recording digitally was difficult, and the last thing Digidesign needed was to have to sell an entirely different workflow and interface.  With this in mind, they made the right choice, and modelled the Pro Tools interface like an analog console.  Audio comes in at the top of the mix window, and flows to the bottom via a chain of effects.  The session view is modelled after an analog tape recorder. As the industry standard, Avid has been hesitant to push large changes to pro-tools, focusing instead on the use-cases of professionals and how to improve their workflow and experience.

From the inception of Ableton, the goal was to do things differently.  A few years of recording in the digital domain, and recording was changing quickly.  Loop-based music had grown in popularity, and the price of making a record had started to come down.  Ableton is based around loops and the concept that everything in a song is synced to a beat, which the DAW should be aware of.  In lieu of custom soundcards and controllers, Ableton was built to be mapped to MIDI controllers originally intended for DJing or Keyboard recording. In the years since it appeared, music has evolved to work incredibly well with Ableton's interface.  Bedroom producers, DJs and live acts have flocked to the software in droves, however it is rare to find a studio running Ableton for their engineers to use.

I love Ableton, but after speaking with many professional recording engineers, I can see why they prefer Pro Tools. The main reason I have seen is that years of whittling away at the UI has produced an environment where almost any action is just a single keyboard shortcut or click away.  I am a big fan of this concept.  As a learner, there is a button for everything, then as a master you can blaze through tasks with ease thanks to shortcuts.  Ableton is not lacking in shortcuts, but in imagining a new way to make music, the developers neglected some of the day-to-day tasks that engineers need to do easily.  One that comes to mind is that in Ableton 9, scrolling through the song in session review is not possible via the mouse-wheel, and requires using a finnicky control that frequently zooms too far and becomes unusable. Other operations are trivial in Ableton, while taking forever in Pro Tools.  One of these that comes to mind is side-chaining.  In Ableton, there is a one dro-down menu option to sidechain input from any track, whereas in pro tools this would require setting up a separate bus, a send, and the receiving drop-down.
