# GADGETS & GIZM⚙️S
Zach Neveu

For better of for worse, I am a chronic gear-head.  Whether I'm looking for a laptop, a water bottle or an app to take notes, I love to obsess about finding the right tools for the job.  Here I review some of the many gadgets and gizmos that I've accumulated.  I try to be fair to each.  Nothing is perfect, but nothing is truly useless either. Many gadgets here are hardware, but expect some software too: virtual tools are still tools!
